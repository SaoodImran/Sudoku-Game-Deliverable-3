# Sudoku-Game-Deliverable-3
Sudoku Game for Principles of Soft. Engineering

For our deliverable 3, we decided to address the user stories more closely related to the user interface, as significant portion of the user stories, and their respective tests, that we have been able to come up with so far have primarily had to do with the user interface in some capacity. The code and construction of the program would also be a fairly straightforward process, as the code is written using a combination of HTML, CSS, and Javascript.

# HOW TO USE OUR PROGRAM
The use of the program is fairly self-explanatory; we advise that you start with opening the MainWindow.html, as this is our main navigation menu that will allow you to access any of the other windows of the program. Although there are two things thatare notable on the function of our game;

1. This program is meant to address the user stories pertaining to the user interface; we have the program setup so that the static objects that ae currently in place can be easily swapped out for functional components.

2. To access different themes for the program, for the purpose of accessibility, you will need to have both .css files in the same folder. MainPageCSS.css contains the formatting for the "Dark" theme and MainPageCSS2.css contains the formatting for the light theme. The Javascript functionality uses the LocalStorage API, so it is not nescessary that you have cookies enabled to use our program!
